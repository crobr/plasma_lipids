# Analysis of circulating metabolites and lipids in AML  

# About
These files were created to analyse the circulating metabolites and lipids from diverse AML patients. Lipids in circulation can aid in predicting AML response to therapy, as well as overall survival. 
These can be used as a template for future metbaolomic and lipidomic work in this field.

These were also used to develop a model to predict therapy response and non-response in diagnosis AML patients. Lipids in circulation were highly associated with patient outcomes based on inital analysis, thus a predictive algorithm was used to select important lipids predictive of outcomes. the resultant model predicts high-risk and low-risk for therapy response, which is highly predictive of AML survival.
